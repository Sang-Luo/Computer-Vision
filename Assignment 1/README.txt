This is my asssignment 1 for Computer Vision. The code is made is python. Please have the libaries
NUMPY and OpenVC for reading and writing images.

Intructions on how to run the program is located in the Report.md at the very end.
All the image files were generated by the code, and my markdown report uses these images.
If you want to delete them you can, but please run the program first to re-generate the images
so my report doesn't look blank.

My report is a markdown file, as thats what I've been using to make reports in my other class.
Please let me know if you would prefer word document instead of markdown, but this was easier for 
me as I had an outline for reports already made in markdown for my other classes.

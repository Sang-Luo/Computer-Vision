## Edge Detection Techniques Analysis

### 1. Introduction
Edge detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling applications like object recognition and image 
segmentation. This project evaluates the performance of three edge detection algorithms: Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny. The 
analysis focuses on their effectiveness under noisy conditions and provides insights into their suitability for various 
tasks.

### 2. Methodology

#### Preprocessing

- Gaussian noise was added to test images to simulate real-world conditions.
- Intensity values were clipped to ensure valid pixel ranges.

#### Algorithms

1. **Sobel**:
   - Computes horizontal and vertical gradients using a weighted kernel.
   - Suitable for strong edges but sensitive to noise.
   
2. **Prewitt**:
   - Simpler gradient computation.
   - Performs well in low-noise conditions.
   
3. **Canny**:
   - Combines gradient computation, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding.
   - Robust to noise, producing clean, continuous edges.

### 3. Results

#### Visual Outputs

- Sobel and Prewitt produce thicker edges and are more sensitive to noise.
- Canny produces cleaner, thinner, and more connected edges.

#### Quantitative Metrics (Example)

If I were to further develop this code, it would measure out these metrics and produce a table as below: 

| Algorithm  | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Sobel      | 70%       | 80%    | 75%      |
| Prewitt    | 68%       | 78%    | 72%      |
| Canny      | 85%       | 90%    | 87%      |

(NOTE: This is an example table and does not represent result output from this project.)

#### Debugging Outputs

- Sobel intensity range: Displayed pixel values for debugging edge detection.
- Prewitt intensity range: Displayed pixel values for debugging edge detection.
- Canny: Verified threshold settings to ensure proper edge detection.

### 4. Discussion

- **Sobel and Prewitt**: Computationally efficient but struggle with noise. Does produce thicker lines, which is not as 
efficient for real-world applications.
- **Canny**: Superior in handling noise and maintaining edge continuity but requires more computational resources. This
does produce very thin but connected lines, making it greate for object recognition, and many other real-world 
applications.
- **Trade-offs**: Choose based on the applicationâ€™s need for speed versus accuracy.

### 5. Applications

Here are some of the possible real-world examples, in which these edge detection can play in:

1. Medical imaging: Detecting organ boundaries.
2. Autonomous vehicles: Lane detection and obstacle recognition.
3. Image processing: Object recognition and segmentation.

---

### 6. Conclusion

The Sobel and Prewitt methods are ideal for simple, low-noise scenarios, while Canny is better suited for tasks 
requiring precision and robustness. Future work could explore adaptive edge detection methods or deep learning-based 
approaches.
